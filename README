I don't know who is the icon author, please, if you know say me! Or give me another icon to the app :D

The WebOS app gives you a identifier autonumeric, so you don't need to register in the webapp. If you don't remove the app, the cookie is setted, so you always will have the same id = same web.

I'm searching for something that could provide me a host to the app.

My mail is agonzalezro _at_ mirblu.com or xota in freenode, tell me your opinion about the app! :)
